# LeetCode-Playground
Just me wrestling with LeetCode problems in Python for funâ€”because who needs Sudoku when you have algorithms to debug and sanity to question?"

# To do:
- [ ] Organize the repo with folders. It's not clear if it's better to have easy-medium-hard or just by numbers.
- [ ] Create a parallel repo with C++/Rust solutions
